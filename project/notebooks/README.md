## Loop Current Mean Location
In this project, I will investigate the mean position and variability of the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico.

## Scientific Question
How does the mean location of the Loop Current vary over time, and what factors influence its position?

## Project Description
To investigate this, I will analyze the Loop Current's path using ocean model outputs and satellite-derived data. Specifically, I will examine sea surface height (SSH), temperature (SST), and velocity fields to track the current's core position. For initial and boundary conditions, I will use data from HYCOM or ECCO. I will run simulations in MITgcm or analyze existing model outputs to determine the Loop Current's mean latitude and longitude over different decades. To quantify shifts, I will calculate the centroid of high SSH anomalies associated with the current. For visualization, I will create maps showing the mean position and a time-lapse animation of its variability. I expect the results to reveal seasonal and interannual shifts, potentially linked to wind forcing or broader climate patterns like ENSO.
