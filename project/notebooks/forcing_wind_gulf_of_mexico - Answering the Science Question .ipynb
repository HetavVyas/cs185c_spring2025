    "## How Does the Mean Location of the Loop Current Vary Over Time — and What Influences It?\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visual inspection of the forcing wind video over the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean location of the Loop Current in the Gulf of Mexico varies significantly throughout the year, shifting northward and retreating southward in response to changes in atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Based on the 2017 wind forcing video, the dominant factor influencing this variability is the zonal wind stress, which alters surface currents through mechanisms like Ekman transport. Periods of strong eastward winds often correlate with a northward extension of the Loop Current, while weakened or reversed wind patterns can lead to its retraction and the shedding of eddies. These eddy shedding events, along with interactions with coastal topography and seasonal changes in temperature and salinity, further contribute to the dynamic behavior of the Loop Current over time.\n"
